hillhacks is a multi-day event so clearly you will need to find somewhere to
stay, keep clean and perform vital bodily functions.  Three options are listed
below not in order of preference.  Feel free to discuss your accommodation hacks on
the [mailing list][ml].


### Campsite

Enjoy the great outdoors.  Camping facilities on the property are limited to
about 6 tents, so this is first-come, first-served.

You can bring your own tent, sleeping mat and sleeping bag. You'll need to pay
a small parking charge. We will also be able to provide tents on rent
this year. If you do not own a tent yet, cheap tents can be bought at Decathlon.
In previous years, local attendees have offered to bulk-buy tents for people and
bring them to the venue.  Please discuss on the [mailing list][ml].

You will be able to share sanitary facilities in the main venue.

#### Camping Costs

**Bring Your Own Tent**
* 100‚Çπ per night<sup>**</sup>

<sup>**</sup> For using basic sanitation facilities at the site.

**Tent provided by Jubish<sup>^^</sup>**

* 4 Person Tent - 800‚Çπ per night

<sup>^^</sup> Need to inform Jubish much in advance.

üìù**Note:** By Default Mattress in tent is not provided, however it
could be arranged by Jubish if requested in advance, at nominal costs.

### Stay nearby

There are plenty of homestays and hotels in and around Thachi Valley. Booking in advance is
recommended.  Use your favourite search engine or app to find a space that suits
your needs and budget suitably near the venue.


### On-site rooms

Rooms are available at the venue. The toilet and bathing facilities in these rooms are
shared by all of the campers on site.

If you are arriving very early in the morning, you may have a nap in the lounge
before you set up your tent later in the day.

You will need to bring your own sheets or a sleeping bag.

<br>üìù**Note:** Some discount for students might be available and can be discussed with Jubish. If that doesn't work, you can ask for help in the [mailing list][ml] or telegram channel.

**Financial aid for stay and food**, for both hackers submitting proposals and ones who are not, may be available. You may write to the community on the [mailing list][ml]. You can volunteer and contribute in other ways ;)

<!--
Please [let us know by email][e] if you would like to stay in a shared room at
the venue so we can plan occupancy.  Note that your stay in a shared room is not
confirmed until we tell you it is.  Preference will be given to attendees with
particular needs (injury, illness, infants, etc.).


### FAQ: Do foreign nationals need a Protected Area Permit (PAP)?

Please be aware that foreign nationals require a Protected Area Permit (PAP) for being out at night in the surrounding areas.

Our hillhacks campsite _does not_ require foreign nationals to get a permit.
However, the nearby surround village (which has all the restaurants) does require a permit post sunset.

To apply for a PAP, submit the following at the registration desk:

- 2 passport size color photographs
- 2 copies of your passport (B/W photocopies should do)
- 2 photocopes of your Indian Visa.

You can get photocopies done nearby, and there is a shop (Digital Seva) near Hotel Surya Classic where you can get passport photos made.

Further [details on the PAP application][pap_details]{:target="_blank"}
are available on the Deer Park Institute website. You can submit these
documents at the Registration Desk and we will get you the permit
via an agent (who is charging us 500 INR/permit). Alternatively,
you can apply for the permit in person at Dharamshala. See the above-mentioned
Deer Park website for how.

**Indian Citizens** staying at the main venue will need to hand over a copy of their identity proof. If you are staying elsewhere, _we don't need it_, but your hotel may.
