Travel to Thachi Valley can involve planes, trains, buses, and/or taxi. 

**Once you have reached Thachi, see the venue details at [the venue page][venue] for more instructions.**

### By plane

The closest airport to Thachi is [Kullu-Manali airport (KUU)][1].  (Beware: due
to weather and other issues, flights to or from Kullu can be cancelled at
the last minute, so it's wise to schedule in some breathing room, and maybe a
Plan B).  If your flight does manage to reach Kullu airport, you can make
the onward journey from there to Thachi by bus or taxi (see the relevant sections
below for details).
