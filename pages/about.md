Hillhacks has been held in the lap of the stunning Dhauladhar Himalayas every summer in 
the state of Himachal Pradesh. There is some buzz of having it in other hilly regions in India, checkout the [mailing list](/contact/) for more information.
in the upcoming editions.

People from different places, walks of life and lines of thought come together
to share, collaborate and learn.

Hackers talk code.  Artists share their creativity.  Students join in from
schools and colleges to learn new skills.  Locals and globals mix and mingle.
We build things like tables, hula hoops, interactive art installations, and
solar lanterns.  We connect.  We dance and sing.  Ideas emerge.  Collaborations
form.  Lives change.

In the hacking, we get hacked ourselves.

### Philosophy

hillhacks is passionate about making, sharing, learning, and the broad concepts
of open source. Freedom, security, and environmentalism are also key to
hillhackers. All of our ideas have conjoined into something exceptionally
creative.

We are just a bunch of people that got connected by crazy and various
circumstances, in a spontaneous and still very dynamic way. Many hillhackers
change direction in life thanks to interactions during hillhacks - starting
school, quitting jobs, moving house, launching projects.

hillhacks is inclusive. Being Excellent to Each Other is a core component of
hillhacks. Everyone is welcome, regardless of economic background, race,
religion, caste, nationality, political view, gender, and age.
