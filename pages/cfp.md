### Context

hillhacks is an annual, community-run event that provides a space for exploring [hacker culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture). Hacker culture is an approach to interacting with technology, art and society. Broadly, it refers to a playful and creative approach of:

- taking things apart to figure out how they work;
- making and modifying things to suit _our_ needs;
- finding a clever way of solving a problem, as opposed to brute force or an expensive way;
- sharing what we learn and make with fellow participants

We are seeking proposals for talks, workshops and discussion sessions for the main programme at hillhacks. The sessons don't necessarily have to be about technology! Over the past four editions, there have been artists, architects, human rights activists, performance artists, hardware and software engineers and designers who've participated at hillhacks.

Some ideas for topics:

1. Hands-on making: Solar-powered LED lanterns, conference badges with LED screens, custom tables or chairs (we can possibly arrange for equipment), Hula hoops with LED strips, interactive installations.
2. Privacy & surveillance: national identification schemes, data protection (see GDPR), building a more secure and decentralized internet, safeguarding our privacy, surveillance at the work place.
3. Current trends: Cryptocurrencies, deep neural networks, decentralized applications.
4. Life experiences: stories from your career, side projects, travels that other participants could learn from.
5. Life skills: Cooking, Nutrition, Fitness, Tidying up, Making a fire, Writing, Public speaking.

Please note that the above list is limited by the writer's imagination. It only serves to stimulate ideas in you. Topics not in the above list are _more_ than welcome.
