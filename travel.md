Travel to Bir can involve planes, trains, buses, and/or taxi.

### By plane

The closest airport to Bir is [Dharamshala airport][1], which is actually in
Gaggal, about 30-45 minutes south of Dharamshala.  Flights between Delhi and
Dharamshala (Gaggal Airport in Kangra) have been suspended, but may be resumed
at some point so check with your travel agent or travel websites.  (Beware: due
to weather and other issues, flights to or from Dharamshala can be cancelled at
the last minute, so it's wise to schedule in some breathing room, and maybe a
Plan B).  If your flight does manage to reach Dharamshala airport, you can make
the onward journey from there to Bir by bus or taxi (see the relevant sections
below for details).

### By train

**Nearest train station: Ahju (2 km away)**

* Option 1 — *Train to Pathankot + bus/taxi onward to Bir*

  The most common way to travel to Bir by train is to take a train from Delhi
  (or wherever your origin may be) to Pathankot/Chakki Bank (two neighbouring
  train stations in the Punjab, either of which is fine) and then make the rest
  of the journey to Bir by bus (6-8 hours) or taxi (4-5 hours).

* Option 2 — *Train to Pathankot + toy train onward to Bir*

  It is also possible to go almost all the way to Bir by train if one has
  considerable patience and/or a profound love for trains.  There is a charming
  little toy train that leaves every morning from Pathankot to Ahju, just 3 km
  from Bir (below the Bir Road intersection).  Most overnight trains from Delhi
  (when running on time) reach Pathankot approximately an hour before the toy
  train leaves, so the connection is doable unless your train from Delhi is
  quite late (which, of course, is always a possibility, though less likely on
  Rajdhani and Shatabdhi express trains).

Which option should I choose?  The toy train is great for some but not for
everyone.  The toy train ride is long (around 7 hours), as slow as a glacier,
and often crowded.  Some people find the long and somewhat bumpy journey tiring.
For others, the beautiful Himalayan scenery more than compensates for any
inconveniences.  If a seven-hour train ride with inspiring views sounds like a
great meditation to you, don't miss it.  Otherwise, consider bus or taxi.  If
you do take the toy train, bring a something soft (e.g. a cushion or a thick
jacket) to sit on to make the rattly ride more comfortable...  and maybe a good
book.

### By bus

**Bus stop nearest to the venue: Chaugan**

* *From Delhi*

  Bir is about 12-14 hours from Delhi by bus.  From the Inter-state Bus Terminal
  (ISBT), take a bus to either Baijnath or Bir Road (the latter is closer, but
  most buses from Delhi only go as far as Baijnath).  There is direct bus
  (Volvo) from Delhi to Bir that departs at 18:48 from ISBT Kashmiri Gate.
  There are two overnight buses from Delhi to Baijnath, both of which depart
  mid-evening and arrive early morning. (Note: If your bus terminates at
  Baijnath, see the [From Baijnath](#from_baijnath) section below for notes on
  how to reach your final destination in Bir from Baijnath).

  Tickets can be booked at
  [http://www.hrtchp.com/hrtctickets/](http://www.hrtchp.com/hrtctickets/).

* *From Pathankot/Chakki Bank*

  Jump on any bus heading for Dharamshala, Kangra, Palampur, Baijnath, Mandi,
  Manali, or Shimla, and then refer to the notes for Dharamshala and Baijnath
  below.

* *From Dharamshala*

  Bir is about four or five hours from Dharamshala by bus, depending on the
  timing of buses and number of connections.  There are three ways to travel
  from Dharamshala to Bir by bus, listed here starting with the most convenient.

  There are two daily direct buses to Bir Road/Upper Bir leaving at 06:00 and
  14:00 from the bus station in (lower) Dharamshala.  (About 4 hours)

  Alternatively, you can take a direct bus from Dharamshala to Baijnath, and
  from there continue onward to Bir either by local bus or by taxi (see the
  [From Baijnath](#from_baijnath) section immediately below).

  If the timing of direct buses to Bir or Baijnath doesn't work for you, the
  last-resort options are these: either take a bus to Palampur and change there
  for any other bus onward to Baijnath or further east, or just hop on any bus
  heading east from Dharamshala, including those to Jogindernagar, Mandi,
  Manali, or Shimla, and ask the driver or conductor to drop you off at Bir Road
  (note: if you get to Chauntra or Jogindernagar, you've gone too far).  This
  can take anywhere from 3 to 5 hours.

  If your bus terminates at Baijnath, you then have the option of travelling the
  last leg to Bir (20-30 minutes) either by bus or by taxi (about Rs. 250).  If
  you choose to go by bus, there are two options.  The most convenient is to
  take one of the direct buses from Baijnath to Bir (which leave about every
  half hour or so and go all the way to Upper Bir).  Alternatively, you can take
  any bus heading east from Baijnath (e.g. Jogindernagar, Mandi, Manali, or
  Shimla) and ask the driver or conductor to drop you off at Bir Road.

  Note that none of the regular buses go to the Tibetan Colony, so if your
  destination is in the Colony, you can either take a taxi from wherever your
  bus drops you or take a bus to Upper Bir and ask the driver or conductor to
  drop you off at Chowgan Chowk (the intersection where Bir Road meets Chowgan
  Road), and then walk west on Chowgan Road about 1km until you reach the
  Tibetan Colony (about 10 minutes on foot).

### By taxi

Taxi is the fastest and most convenient way of getting to Bir from Pathankot or
Dharamshala, but it is also by far the most expensive and the least
eco-friendly, so if you come by car, please consider sharing the ride with
others.
