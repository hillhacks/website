Source code for the hillhacks website.

## Compiling

You have to have [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) introduced. Follow its 

establishment directions for your foundation. 

Aggregate the site with ''jekyll b''. You can have a worker running 

utilizing 'jekyll serve [- - watch] [[- - incremental]' with the discretionary 

'- - watch' banner to naturally recover the site on record spares 

what's more, the '- - steady' banner to just create what is required. 

The site utilizes [kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html) 

what's more, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/formats/) for language structure 

what's more, templating.
