Source code for the hillhacks website.

## Compiling

You need to have [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) installed.  Follow its
installation instructions for your platform.

Compile the site with ``jekyll b``. You can have a server running 
using `jekyll serve [--watch] [[--incremental]` with the optional
`--watch` flag to automatically regenerate the site on file saves
and the `--incremental` flag to only generate what is needed.

The site uses [kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html)
and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/) for syntax
and templating.
