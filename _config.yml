  hillhacks is held in the lap of the stunning Dhauladhar Himalayas every
  summer.  People from different places, walks of life and lines of thought come
  together to share, collaborate and learn. Hackers talk code.  Artists share
  their creativity. Students join in from schools and colleges to learn new
  skills.  Locals and globals mix and mingle.  We build things like tables, hula
  hoops, interactive art installations, and solar lanterns. We connect. We dance
  and sing. Ideas emerge.  Collaborations form. Lives change.  In the hacking,
  we get hacked ourselves.
