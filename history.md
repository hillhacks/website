hillhacks began in 2013 as a conversation between Ritu and Tenzin, founders of
the [Dharamsala International Film Festival][1], and Akiba, a hacker/maker from
[Freaklabs][2] in Japan.  It soon expanded to include Ayush Ghai from
[Ghoomakad][3] (Infinity Hackbase) in nearby Rakkar, and sva from Germany.
Within a year the first hillhacks took place.
