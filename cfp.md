### About hillhacks

hillhacks is a three-part event where super-specialists, novices and everyone
in-between who associate themselves with various fields of technology, sciences,
humanities, and arts come together to reflect, create, and share.

We are soliciting proposals for talks, workshops, and other sessions for the
[conference](#main-conference), [unconference](#unconference) and [school
programme](#school-programme).

### Main conference

**Dates: 18-21 May 2017**

The main conference consists of four days of curated talks and workshops.

Topics include but are not limited to:

* Hardware
* Software
* Data
* Security
* Futurism
* Freedom
* Art
* Architecture
* Ecology
* Nature

In previous editions of hillhacks and [hackbeach](https://hackbeach.in/) (our
sister conference in Kerala) we've had talks about Net Neutrality[^1],
surveillance[^2], an introduction to lambda calculus[^3], 3D printing[^4], the
need for concrete[^5], and a lot of other interesting sessions.  Oh, and we also
had a session where one of our friends called us from North Korea[^6]!

### Unconference

**Dates: 15-17 & 22-31 May 2017**

The unconference, in the days before and after the main conference, is a less
structured time where almost anything goes.  Bring your idea and materials, and
gather a crew on the spot.  No proposals are required.  [Join the hillhacks
mailing list][ml] and tell everyone about your plan --- you may drum up some
collaborators or an eager audience.

{% include btn-join-mailing-list.html %}

Folks at the unconference usually end up playing a big role in putting the event
together and creating the vibe.  You could participate in making our space look
fabulous by creating an installation with found objects or maybe even building a
structure.  You might want to make a barbecue or you just want to run the
barbecue every day.  We love caring for garbage and you could help us in
managing the compost pit.  At one of of our previous events, we built a
telescope together.  Other previous unconference highlights have included
performances, Rubik's cubes, cooking classes, film screenings, music jams,
barbering, coding games, telescope construction, juggling, unicycling, yoga,
philosophy discussions and carpentry.

Whatever your idea may be, just share it enthusiastically and you're bound to
gather a crew, on the [mailing list][ml] or on the spot.  Don't forget,
hillhacks is created by its participants and so please bring along key materials
required (if any) for what you intend to lead.  If there are some basic
infrastructural requirements for what you have in mind, please let us know in
advance and we'll do our best to sort it out.
