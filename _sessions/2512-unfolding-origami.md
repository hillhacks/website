The practice of folding paper and cloth into abstract shapes and designs has existed for many centuries in Europe and Asia. However, in the 1960's this practice acquired a new language. 

First came the system of encoding a form in a crease pattern- a set of lines drawn on a square to represent the folds required to make a form. Following this came a system of communicating folding sequences using arrows and symbols which led to a further expansion of this language. The result of this was an explosion of new origami designs and ideas. 

In this sessions I will talk about a brief history of origami and how learning its language unlocked my interest in it. I will demo all the basic folds and bases used in origami and also discuss the preliminary concepts involved in designing your own origami. This session is intended for beginners.
