**'Mottainai'** is a Japanese word that literally translates to wasteful. In spirit, it is the philosophy of extending the lifetime of the goods or devices we own by creating multiple uses for them. 

Increasingly, humanity is moving in the direction where our lives are incongruent with the ecosystems or environments we thrive within.  
What're the ways in which we can mitigate this problem on an individual level, on a local community level or within our countries?

Reuse, Recycle, Reduce

The first step is in figuring out what kind of waste we generate in our individual households and within the community and the next step is figuring out how to reuse, recycle and reduce.

This discussion is meant to be a platform to introduce somebody to the ways of this lifestyle and practical ways to do so.
