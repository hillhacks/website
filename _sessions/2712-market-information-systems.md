The wide adoption of mobile phones over the past 3-4 years has changed the landscape of vegetable markets in rural Bihar.  Farmers can call to check prices at different markets before deciding where to bring their vegetables; more long-distance traders shuttle vegetables between markets, stabilizing the prices; and an increasing number of farm-gate traders bypass the markets all together, arranging deals over the phone to pick up vegetables directly from the villages.  Many of the farmers we interviewed reported getting better prices in recent years, with fewer price crashes.

In development circles, market information systems have been a favorite example of the potential for information technologies to improve rural livelihoods.  The idea is simple: once farmers know the prices for all the nearby markets, they can increase their incomes by simply going to the market that has the best prices.

Research on market information systems have shown mixed results, however.  Many evaluations have not been able to show that market information systems lead to a significant increase in farmer income, or a change in market choice behavior.  (See section 3.4 of this paper: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jid.3314 ).





Even when farmers know that prices are better at a different market, there are many reasons why they often choose not to go:

- Risk: vegetable prices can fluxuate wildly, even within a single day.  Farmers often worry that prices will crash, and don't trust that they'll actually get the prices reported by a market informaiton service. 

- Personal relationships: farmers sometimes don't want to take their vegetables to other markets, in fear of hurting their relationships with gaddidars (commission agents) at their local markets.  It's fairly common for farmers to get credit from gaddidars, requiring them to sell vegetables through them.

- Time, maybe the most important reason: Farmers and busy, and it takes too long to go to a distant market.

- Volume: Farmers often have a large-enough quantity of vegetables to cover the expenses of going to distant markets by themselves.

- Market capacity: Small markets can only handle so many vegetables until prices crash.  If prices are good, too many farmers might send vegetables there.

- Unfamiliarity: Farmers' are sometimes hesitant to go to new markets where they don't have any connections and don't know who to trust. 




I've spent the past few months as an intern for Digital Green, a global NGO that works to improve farmers' incomes and livelihoods.

In this talk, I'll present insights from farmer interviews about market choice, and some UX design work for a market information system that hopes to address some of these barriers.
