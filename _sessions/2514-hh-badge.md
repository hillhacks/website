The goal of this workshop will be to walk you through KiCad basics so that you are able to get started. This will involve designing a simple design from sketch to gerber. We will cover following topics:

- Schematic design
- Netlist
- PCB layout
- Library Management
- Gerber generation

I  haven't finalised the circuit which we will design. Interested people are welcome to propose a basic circuit. People can propose it via mailing list or on twitter by tagging me in their post (@Nitesh_Kadyan)

This session will also be used for giving away the HillHacks electronic badge for people who backed for it. Thee badge will be provided with a set of lapel pins and a hillhacks lanyard. I will also share some personal motivation behind making the badge.

People who haven't backed for the badge can still do it <a href='https://goo.gl/forms/FejCmntk9Ott2CMh2'>here</a>. It costs 2200 INR or approx $33.
