Earlier this year, Steve Wozniak caused much controversy over his claim that Indians do not have creative technical ideas. Without putting it in as many words, he seems to say Indian engineers are boring. While much has been said in favour of and in opposition to this, I am interested in a strange paradox - 1)Indian engineering is several decades old. Yet in this time, there has been not a single iconic Indian technical idea that can stand up and be counted along with the likes of Japan's Walkman or Germany's cars (People like the ones that come to hillhacks are a minority, I'm interested in structural problems here). In the same time (Post independence), arts have flourished - Indian music and cinema for eg., rank among the world's best. 2)India has one of the largest thriving second-hand or refurbishment markets (electronics and various hardware for eg.) and it has its own cultural form of technical bricolage - Jugaad - a putting together of diverse objects gathered from what is at hand, to solve a problem that immediately confronts the jugaadu. Most of the people engaged in these practices are not college educated, not even school-educated in many cases. Yet they know what a AA battery is, which unfortunately, is something a lot of engineering students in the country don't know about. Over and above all this, we have politicians who claim the internet was invented in Indic pre-history, during the days of the mahabharatha!!

Between these impasses, I would like to ask the question - is there a distinctly indian form of technical education or practice that will help to bridge this divide. Towards this end, I would like to propose a group activity .

The session will begin with a 15 minute presentation where I try to outline the problem in a little more detail and lay out particular symptoms of interest. Following this, we split into teams and try to analyse the issue and configure strategies for intervention. The intention is not to transform education policy or redesign course syllabi, but to find effective, efficient ways of creating nucleii of transformative action in local spaces that helps to concatenate existing creative channels.
