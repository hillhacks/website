### Description
- The session will teach attendees about the privacy principle Encryption: “Communication over a network, unless strongly encrypted, is never just between two parties”.
- The attendees will learn how intermediary devices, and the services that provide them, are involved in transmitting information from point A to point B on the Internet.
- The attendees will learn about Encryption through a group activity and will be able to understand its importance.
### Agenda
- Introduction - 5 Mins
- Tools Demo - 15 Mins
  - Mozilla Codemoji - A fun way to learn about cyphers - 10 Mins

  - You get Signal: A visual trace route tool - 5 Mins
    - http://bit.ly/traceroute
- Group Activity - 30 Minutes

    **Note: This activity can be done using codemoji but that depends if everyone has access to internet. If not I am going to go with below offline activity**
    - Part 1: Unencrypted Communication - 5 Mins
        - 3 attendees will come forward and be named as Sender (A), Network(B), Receiver(C). A will pass the message to C via B in unencrypted form
    - Part 2: Passing Encrypted Notes - 25 Mins
        - Group A & C will breakup for 10 mins & come up with their own encryption code on a sheet of paper.
        - Group B will be allowed to eavesdrop and try to strategize about how to break the code.
        - Group A and C will send a note to each other via Group B, with a message written in the encryption code
        - Group B will be asked if they could decipher the code or not.
- Final Q&A - 10 Mins

**Note:** 
    - For upto 6 attendees, 3 pairs of A, B and C will be formed.
    - For upto 12 attendees, 6 pairs of A, B and C with 2 pair each will be formed. For Ex: A- 2 pairs, B- 2 pairs, C- 2 pairs.
    - For more than 12 attendees, there will be multiple groups of A, B and C.
