This talk makes an attempt to broadly answer the question “What is Information Architecture?” through examples from various spheres of life. It further outlines the foundational ways of organising information and includes a participatory activity to understand the practice of IA. I have previously presented this talk at World IA Day, and I plan to refine it further. Slides from the previous talk can be viewed here.
