The Sari, at its basic, is an unstitched fabric that can be draped into any garment of choice using just knots and pleats. It can become a pair of pants like the dancers of Odisha or a pair of shorts like the Goan fisherwomen. Or one could take inspiration from the farmlands of West Bengal and wear the Sari as a short gown or one could imitate the agricultural women of Andhra Pradesh who wear their Sari as functional, aesthetic dresses. Rta Kapur Chishti, a renowned Sari historian and a textile scholar, has documented a 108 ways to wear a Sari in her book “Saris of India” that was put together after a decade of travelling across thirteen states in India.

Apart from women, men in the Indian sub-continent have also been wearing the unstitched since centuries. Dhotis have been ubiquitous all through hot and humid India. In this one hour seminar, we will delve into the gender-neutral and gender-fluid Sari as a garment of choice for men, womxn and people.

The audience will learn how to harness the fluidity of the Sari to express themselves and their individuality. I will be taking inspiration from the ancient wisdom of our ancestors to imagine the Sari in a contemporary context. Together, we will hack the Sari to extend its capabilities beyond the popular NiVi and Gujarati drapes to realize the power and energy of the Sari.

The intense and interactive session will also include conversations on colonization, fluid gender, minimalism and sustainability whose narratives are intrinsically interwoven with the Sari. The seminar will be followed by draping a few members from the audience.

Intended audience: Art, science, history, fashion, handloom researchers and enthusiasts, intersectional feminists, and gender activists, fashion nerds.
