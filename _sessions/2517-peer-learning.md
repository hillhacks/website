In an era where information is literally at your fingertips:

* What still drives learning? 
* What do peer to peer learning communities look like? 
* What learning pedagogies are most effective? 

In this talk I would like to share my learnings from participating in different learning environments over the last 5 years. 

**Jaaga Study**

* A fully p2p learning environment residency on a farm outside Bangalore. This was a completely self-driven learning environment. 
Learners painstakingly had to find out what they needed to learn, chart their own learning path with very minimal guidance. All this while living in a village and sharing limited 4G Bandwidth. My role at Jaaga was that of a Program Cooridnator / Operations Manager.  This environment inspired me to learn programming. 

**GeekSkool**

* A free programmer school in Bangalore. GeekSkooolers spend all day at the GeekHouse exploring a multitude of programming languages and projects. Right from writing their own JSON parser to Booting their own OS. All this with the guidance of just one mentor! I was part of the first cohort at GeekSkool learning JavaScript. 

**MountBlue**

* MountBlue is an intensive programming bootcamp. MountBlue invests in trainees' skills and finds startups for them to work at. Leveraging mostly open resources, a co-working space and peers MountBlue puts people to work in 9 weeks! I currently work as a mentor at MountBlue.
