Markov Chains Models are the foundation of many Natural Language Processing algorithms. They ask 'given the previous X number of items in a sequence, what is likely to come next?' You can see Markov Models in action by playing with the word-suggestions when you're typing on your phone.

The workshop will cover:

- The basics: what is a markov model, and how do they work? We'll do a short exercise diagramming out a model on paper, and calculating the probabilities.

- Some variants: Hidden-state Markov Models (HMM's), interpolated markov models, sequence generation, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)

- Some MCM applications for NLP and bioinformatics: like voice recognition, sentence parsing, fuzzy-matching, language detection, forensic stylometry, gene-finding, and protein structure analysis

- If time permits, maybe the Virterbi algorithm for finding highest-probability paths through a markov model
