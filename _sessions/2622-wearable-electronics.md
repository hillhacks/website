Wear your code and lighten up your dresses.

In this talk am going to show few of my projects I've been doing lately such as:
1. FireWalkers - LED Shows
2. Tron Hoodie - EL Wire Hoodie 
3. iBow-T - OLED based BOW tie
4. Desk Jewel - Programmable custom LED Paper Weight and many more

All this things are programmed and requires few basic skills of electronics, soldering, stitching and power management.
