Art therapy is a practice that involves drawing and craft work. Research has shown that indulging in art improves individual's physical, mental and emotional well-being. Since, art is a tool of expression - by involving in art, one can align oneself to his/her creative side and reap benefits in professional and personal lives.
Zendoodling is specialised art of designs which involves using structured patterns.

This may be seen as intricate drawing. One can fill their drawing with as many designs as they want - whatever comes to mind in flow. Zendoodling helps in calming down our mind and provides relaxation. 
Being in Bir, amongst mountains and pleasant weather, for Hillhacks is itself a rejuvenating experience. Indulging oneself in art will further help to enhance the effect.
The aim of this workshop is to bring out our creative side and enhance our physiological well-being.
